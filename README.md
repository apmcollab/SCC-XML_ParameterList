## XML_ParameterList

XML_ParameterListArray class instances are collections of parameter lists (lists of parameters and their values) that are expressed in XML syntax. The specific XML structure of an XML_ParameterListArray and the member functions for managing these lists, were chosen by their utility for specifying and working with input files for programs performing scientific computation.

This source distribution includes the source for a version of TinyXML-1 with a small change identified in the TinyXML_Changes file.  This code has not been tested against the newer version of TinyXML, TinyXML-2
