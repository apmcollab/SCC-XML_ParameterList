## XML_ParameterList

XML_ParameterListArray class instances are collections of parameter lists (lists of parameters and their values) that are expressed in XML syntax. The specific XML structure of an XML_ParameterListArray and the member functions for managing these lists, were chosen by their utility for specifying and working with input files for programs performing scientific computation.
